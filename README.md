# What is API?

API Stands for Application Programming Interface, it is set of rules or protocols that provides interface \
between two software application to interact with each other and transfer data securely.

API simplifies software programming by enabling developer to integrate data,feature and functionality from other applications,\
instead of building them from scratch. API applications gives simple and secure way to make application data and functionality available to both developers and user clients.

APIs are predefined interfaces that only provide required data for specific requests.\
it doesn`t provide full data, it keeps inetrnal details hidden which helps to maintain system security. 

For example : In Aviation and Logistic related applications instead of developing their own weather forecast they use api to collect required weather data.



# How Actually API Works?
API uses client-server model to exchange data using request and response method.

THE Application submitting request is called client. server provides the response.\
